---

## 📥 Installation

1. **Install a script manager**: [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) is recommended first. [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) is also supported.
2. **Install the script**: Click **[Install Now](https://github.com/digbug82/PikPak_Enhancement_Master/raw/main/PikPak_Enhancement_Master.user.js)**.
3. **Open PikPak Web**: Visit [PikPak](https://mypikpak.com/drive) and log in to your account.
4. **Launch PikPak Enhancement Master**:
   * In normal mode: after login, click the floating blue **PikPak Logo ball** in the sidebar.
   * In Turbo Mode: after login, the script can open automatically and take over the native web interface.

---

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why doesn’t the blue floating ball appear after installing the script?**  
**A: Please check the following in order:**

1. Make sure **PikPak Enhancement Master** is enabled in your script manager.
2. Make sure you have logged in to PikPak Web.
3. If you are using **Tampermonkey**, make sure **“Allow user scripts”** is enabled on the browser extension details page.
4. Chrome / Edge latest versions are recommended.
5. If the floating ball still does not appear after the steps above, temporarily disable all other browser extensions and refresh the page (F5).

**Q: What is Turbo Mode, and why is it recommended?**  
**A:** Once enabled, the script deeply takes over the native web logic and covers the main interface in full screen. It actively blocks the original page’s high-memory sync workflow, which significantly reduces lag, crashes, and loading delays in large-file environments.  
**Note:** After enabling Turbo Mode, the minimize and close buttons are hidden automatically. To return to the original web page, disable it in Settings.  
**Recommendation:** If your cloud drive contains many files, Turbo Mode is strongly recommended for a smoother and more stable experience.

**Q: Why does My Pack show the “Default” tag, and why can’t it be starred, copied, moved, renamed, or deleted?**  
**A:** This is PikPak’s official protection mechanism for the default directory. The script keeps this protection logic, but it removes the sharing restriction on the default folder **My Pack**.

**Q: What is the difference between Deduplicate Files and Folder Deduplication? How should I choose between them?**  
**A:**  
**Deduplicate Files:** Designed for single-file-level comparison. It uses **Hash Exact Match, Video Duration Similarity, and Name Similarity**, making it suitable for cleaning scattered duplicate files such as repeated single-episode videos, single images, or standalone archives.  

**Folder Deduplication:** Designed for whole-folder-level comparison. It uses **Name Matching, internal file overlap matching, and containment matching**, making it more suitable for cleaning duplicated full series folders, image packs, or multi-level resource folders. Even if two folders have different names, they can still be detected if their internal files are highly similar or if one folder is largely contained within another.

> **Recommendation:**  
> In file deduplication, **Exact Match** is hash-based and the most reliable, so it is usually safe to batch-select for deletion.  
> **Duration Match**, **Name Match**, and the three folder deduplication modes are all similarity-based matching methods, so manual review is recommended before batch deletion.

**Q: Why do more and more duplicates appear over time? Did the full-disk index miss some files?**  
**A:** No. This is not caused by missing index data or data corruption. The number of results in **Exact Match** is usually stable. The reason more duplicates appear later is that similarity matching based on **video duration** becomes more complete over time.  

Some PikPak APIs do not directly provide video duration, so many duplicate videos are skipped in early analysis because duration data is missing. To solve this, the script includes a background metadata sniffing mechanism that reads video metadata, fills in precise durations, and stores them persistently in the browser. As your local duration database becomes more complete, the deduplication engine can detect more hidden duplicates with different names but the same actual duration.

**Q: Why does Image Search sometimes ask me to paste instead of uploading the image directly?**  
**A:** This is caused by browser security restrictions, mainly **CORS** limitations. When the script cannot directly send the image from your cloud drive to the target search service, it automatically copies the current frame or image to your clipboard. You can then press `Ctrl + V` in the opened search page to submit it.

**Q: Why do I get audio but no video when playing certain files?**  
**A:** This usually happens when the video is an **m3u8 multi-audio-track / multi-track stream**. After cloud transcoding, the audio and video tracks may be separated, and the browser player may not support full online parsing of this type of stream.  
In this case, click **External Play** and use a professional local player such as PotPlayer.

**Q: What is the difference between “Original (Fast)” and regular “Original”?**  
**A:** In most cases, the picture quality is nearly identical. The main difference is the underlying transmission and decoding route.  
**Original (Fast)** uses an official streaming-optimized path, which usually provides faster loading, smoother seeking, and more stable playback in external players such as PotPlayer.  
**Recommendation:** Whether playing in the browser or externally, **Original (Fast)** is usually the better first choice.

**Q: Why don’t changes I made in the mobile app or official web client appear immediately in File Analysis or deduplication lists?**  
**A:** To keep searching, filtering, and analysis fast, the script relies heavily on local memory snapshots and cached indexes instead of refetching tens of thousands of files every time.  
If you have just made many changes in the mobile app or official web client, refresh the page to rebuild the latest full-disk index.  
**Recommendation:** Avoid modifying the same batch of files from multiple clients while running analysis, deduplication, or organizing tasks.

**Q: Can I assign different passwords for multiple archives during Bulk Extract?**  
**A:** Yes. **Bulk Extract** uses the **Password Vault** for smart matching. As long as you save known passwords in the vault in advance, the script will automatically try all stored passwords on each archive. Once a match is found, extraction starts automatically with no need for manual input one by one.

**Q: When Bulk Extract says “System busy / Waiting to retry,” is the script broken?**  
**A:** No. This usually means PikPak’s cloud service has triggered concurrency or rate limits. It is an official-side busy-state issue, not a script malfunction.  
If a file still fails after several retries, it may be damaged, restricted, or affected by temporary cloud-side instability. Try again later or download it locally and process it there.

**Q: What is included in the exported JSON backup?**  
**A:** The exported JSON contains only local configuration data from PikPak Enhancement Master, such as deduplication preferences, blacklist / whitelist rules, Password Vault data, some history records, and feature settings.  
It **does not include** your PikPak account password, so it is safe to use for backup and migration across devices.

**Q: Will Import Backup overwrite my current settings or lists?**  
**A:** Usually not. The script uses a **smart merge** strategy on import. List-type data such as Resource Manager records and history entries are deduplicated and merged instead of simply overwritten.  
Only a small number of basic settings, such as the image search engine or Aria2 RPC URL, may use the values from the imported file, so your long-term local lists and records are usually preserved.

**Q: Why are some files protected or not deleted during batch deletion?**  
**A:** Check whether those files have already been recorded in **Resource Manager**. If you have enabled “skip resources recorded in Resource Manager when deleting” in Settings, matched files will be treated as protected items to prevent accidental deletion.  
**Solutions:**  
1. Disable the protection rule in Settings and try deleting again.  
2. Or open **Resource Manager** from the toolbar / sidebar and choose **Run Cleanup Now** to physically clean those recorded items.

**Q: Why doesn’t anything appear after I use Paste?**  
**A:** First check whether your cloud storage still has enough free space. PikPak often handles **storage quota exceeded** situations through a silent block, meaning the action may simply stop in the background without a clear popup warning.  
If nothing appears after Paste, the most common cause is insufficient remaining storage. Clean up some space first, then try again.

**Q: What is “Auto repair anti-block magnet links,” and when should I enable it?**  
**A:** This feature automatically removes unrelated Chinese text, emojis, symbols, and other noise inserted into magnet links, then extracts the useful hash and reconstructs a standard magnet format.  
**Recommendation:** Keep it enabled by default. It is especially useful for links copied from social platforms, forums, or chat apps where the magnet string may be polluted, partially removed, or intentionally obfuscated.  
For already standard links beginning with `magnet:?`, the script will skip repair automatically and download normally.

**Q: What is Folder Download Filter, and which download methods does it affect?**  
**A:** **Folder Download Filter** automatically excludes matched files by extension or naming rules when downloading an entire folder. For example, you can exclude `.txt`, `.jpg`, or files whose names contain certain keywords. It affects both normal folder downloads and **Aria2 / Motrix** folder-push scenarios.

**Q: Is folder structure preserved when downloading via Aria2 / Motrix or the browser?**  
**A:**  
**Aria2 / Motrix: Yes, structure is preserved.**  
The script automatically clones and restores the cloud directory tree when pushing tasks. After download, the local folder hierarchy will match the cloud structure as closely as possible. It also sanitizes Windows-unsupported characters such as `:` `*` `?` and shortens overly long paths to reduce download failures.  

**Browser native download: No, structure is not preserved.**  
Due to browser download limitations, files inside folders are usually flattened into a single local directory.  

**Recommendation:** If you need the original folder hierarchy, use **Aria2 / Motrix** whenever possible.

**Q: What is Data Migration, and how does it work?**  
**A:** **Data Migration** lets you quickly and seamlessly transfer files or folders from the current account to another PikPak account.  
**Steps:**  
1. Select the files or folders you want to migrate in the current account.  
2. Click the **Data Migration** button.  
3. The script encrypts and packages the data automatically, then logs out of the current account.  
4. Log in to the target account.  
5. After login, the script detects the local migration package automatically and prompts you to receive it in one click.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

* **Local-first**: All core capabilities interact directly with official PikPak APIs through your browser. Your account token, Password Vault data, and most local configuration data remain in the local browser environment by default.
* **No active collection**: The script **does not actively collect** user privacy data, and **will never** upload your file information or account credentials to any third-party server.
* **Third-party services**: Only when using extended features such as **Search Online** subtitles or **Image Search** will the script send the necessary search keywords or image features to related public services. No personal identity information is involved.
